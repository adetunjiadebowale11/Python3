Carly thinks she can bring in more customers by advertising all of the haircuts she has that are under 30 dollars.

Use a list comprehension to create a list called cuts_under_30 that has the entry hairstyles[i] for each i for which new_prices[i] is less than 30.

You can use range() in your list comprehension to make i go from 0 to len(new_prices) - 1
